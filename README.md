## Project Architecture

This project follows **Feature-Sliced Design (FSD)** principles with the Next.js App Router to ensure a scalable and maintainable codebase.

src/

├── app/ # Next.js pages, routes, and layouts

├── processes/ # Business flows that involve multiple features

├── widgets/ # Composite UI components with business logic (e.g., Sidebar, Header)

├── features/ # Business-level features (e.g., authentication, exercise management)

├── entities/ # Core business entities (e.g., User, Exercise, Workout)

├── shared/ # Shared libraries, UI components, and configuration

└── styles/ # Global CSS and themes



This structured design promotes clear domain isolation and reusability across the application.
